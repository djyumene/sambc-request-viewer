Simple Request Viewer for SAMBC

This is a simple request viewer that I made to display requests and dedacations.
Just enter your database details in the db-config.php file, upload to your web server and you're good to go.

Files:

- admin-ip.php (Viewer w/ IP addresses)
- db-config.php (Database Config)
- index.php (Public Viewer)
- css/style.css (Stylesheet)

Enjoy!
